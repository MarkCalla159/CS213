                <p>
                    Not only did OG win the first ever Dota 2 Valve major, they also were the first team to claim four of them. They’re also currently the only team to ever be crowned World Dota 2 Champions twice.
                    Willing to take a step further in becoming an esports powerhouse, we decided to create OG Seed, to help grow Dota 2 players, and welcomed an amazing CS:GO roster as well.
                    We may be skilled, but the true strength of OG is its people.
