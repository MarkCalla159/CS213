                <p class="responsivePar">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure 
                    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the 
                    actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.<br><br>

                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who
                     do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
                     Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is 
                     pain, but because occasionally.</p>

                    Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast 
                    of the Semantics, a large language ocean.<br><br>

                    A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is 
                    a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful
                     Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a 
                     small line of blind text by the name.</p>

                    mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence 
                    in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.<br><br>

                    I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that 
                    I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and 
                    yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
